<h3>Gentoo Linux - The best distro for fast hardware - 25rd June 2016</h3>

Linux distros have come a long way since I started using and testing them back in 2009. Especially networking and sound. The maintainers of the Linux
kernel really do an awesome job at reverse-engineering the drivers available on other platforms and porting the code over. 

I have tried and tested every distribution there is under the sun. I've tried *buntu, Fedora, SUSE-based, RHEL-based, and, the most awesomeone, Gentoo.
<h3>What makes Gentoo so awesome?</h3>What makes it so awesome? It's fast. Really fast. It's among the fastest Linux distributions available. What makes it fast? You can specify what you 
want and what you need in so called <b>USE</b> flags. Every piece of sofrware has options that you can specity when you are compiling it. 
For example, programs that need cryptography can use more than one option to compile into the program. There is GNUtls, OpenSSL and nss. Portage, 
the Gentoo package manager, reads those flags and configures software based on your needs. Don't use systemd? Specify <b>-systemd</b> into the 
USE flags, and every program will get compiled without any systemd support. Don't use pulseaudio? Specify <b>-pulseaudio</b> and all programs compile
without any pulseaudio support. You get the drill. 
Having such an optimized package manager, that only builds what you need, makes programs run faster, because they don't
support useless features that you don't use.
<h3>GCC Optimizations</h3>Software can run faster with more compiler optimization. The GNU C Compiler has flags called <b>-O</b> that optimize the compiled
code to run faster. From the GNU Docs:
<pre class="code">
Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results. 
Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint between statements, you can then assign 
a new value to any variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the function and get exactly the results 
you expect from the source code.
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation 
time and possibly the ability to debug the program.
The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the program. Compiling multiple files at once to a single 
output file mode allows the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling each of them.
</pre>This can be seen in the real world when making software for the Raspberry Pi under embedded Linux. The GPIO pins can be used to produce a square
signal wave. The frequency of that wave depends on the speed of the software. Here is some simple code that uses the native C library for toggling the
signal pins on, then off:
<pre class="code">
INP_GPIO(4);
OUT_GPIO(4);

while(1) {
  GPIO_SET = 1&lt;&lt;4;
  GPIO_CLR = 1&lt;&lt;4;
}
</pre>Quoting from <a href="http://codeandlife.com/2012/07/03/benchmarking-raspberry-pi-gpio-speed/">this article</a> I also got the code from:
<pre class="code">
Without any optimizations, I got an excellent 14 MHz square wave. Adding -O3 to the compile command (gcc -O3 strobe.c -o strobe) increases the 
rate to hefty 22 MHz.</pre>You get the idea what compiler optimization does.
<h3>The good, the bad, and the ugly</h3>Compiling takes time. A lot of time. Infact, it takes up so much time, it is almost pointless to run Gentoo. Here is
a table of time it took me to compile some popular programs:
<pre class="code">
Chromium		1.8h
Firefox			1.5h
LibreOffice		2.4h
LLVM			2h
Linux 4.6.2		45m
NetworkManager		25m
</pre>It is really, really slow. It's not Gentoo's fault tho, it's mine. I use a Lenovo T61 from 2008 that has an Intel Core2 Duo T8300 ticking at 2.4GHz.
If I had a faster computer, I would run Gentoo all the time, without a doubt. But, allocating a full day or two for a system update is really not worth 
the time, on my laptop.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>If you have a Intel or AMD processor with 6/8 cores, or more, and are seeking the absolute maximum performance from your 
computer, give Gentoo a shot. It will not disappoint. And if you have trouble deciding, should you use OpenRC or systemd, here is a 
simple guideline: Are you used to seamless use permissions and fast system startup? systemd. Do you like the "old school" init system style and 
want tighter permission management and tighter security and stability, use OpenRC.
