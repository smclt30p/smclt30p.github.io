			<p class="post-body">
				I decided to start a blog and post my tech insights and opinions.
				<br><br>
				This blog is managed via git, if you want to see the individual commits, they can be found at 
				<a href="https://github.com/smclt30p/smclt30p.github.io/commits/master">
				https://github.com/smclt30p/smclt30p.github.io/commits/master</a>
				<br><br>
				This should go on daily if I have the time to write it. Which i have plenty.
