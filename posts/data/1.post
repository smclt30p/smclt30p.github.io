# Starting a blog - 7th June 2016
#### So much free time.
* * *

I decided to start a blog and post my tech insights and opinions.

This blog is managed via git, if you want to see the individual commits, they can be found [here][link]. 

This should go on daily if I have the time to write it. Which i have plenty.
